# A Ruby template language inspired by JSX

Love JSX and component-based frontends, but sick of paying the costs of SPA development? Rbexy brings the elegance of JSX—operating on HTML elements and custom components with an interchangeable syntax—to the world of Rails server-rendered apps.

Combine this with a component library like Github's view_component and build CSS Modules into your Webpacker PostCSS pipeline—you'll have a first-class frontend development experience while maintaining the development efficiency of Rails.

_But what about Javascript and client-side behavior?_ You probably don't need as much of it as you think you do. See how far you can get with layering RailsUJS, vanilla JS, Turbolinks, and/or StimulusJS onto your server-rendered components. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the modern UX you're able to build while writing and maintaining less code.

## Example

Use your custom Ruby class components from `.rbx` templates just like you would React components in JSX:

```rbx
<body>
  <Hero size="fullscreen" {**splat_some_attributes}>
    <h1>Hello {@name}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to rbexy, marrying the nice parts of React templating with the development efficiency of Rails server-rendered apps.</p>
    <Button to={about_path}>Learn more</Button>
  </Hero>
</body>
```

after defining them in Ruby:

```ruby
class HeroComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def initialize(size:)
    @size = size
  end
end

class ButtonComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def initialize(to:)
    @to = to
  end
end
```

with their accompying template files (also can be `.rbx`!), scoped scss files, JS and other assets (not shown).
